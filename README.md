### Introduction
Welcome to "Ticketist", the app to rule all the ticket management systems. I have decided to create an app with this theme because I am a huge fan of public transportation and I find it a very customisable and challenging theme to implement. Also, I hate the concept of personal car as a transportation mean.

### Main logic sections
